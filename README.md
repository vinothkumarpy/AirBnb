# Airbnb Analysis with Tableau

**Introduction**

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze the Airbnb data extracted from MongoDB Atlas. Developed a Streamlit application for trend analysis, pattern recognition, and data insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Explored variations in price, location, property type, and seasons through dynamic plots and charts.

**Technologies and Skills**
